# kill

Syntax:
-------
	kill [options] <PID> [...]

Description:
------------
	kill sends signal to  processes. The dafault signal is TERM.

Options:
--------
	<pid> [...]							Send signal to every pid listed.
	-/-s [signal]	--signal [signal]	Specify the signal to be sent. Signal can be specified either by name or number.
	-l				--list [signals]	List signals. If signal names are given, print signal names and vice versa. If nothing is specified,
										print all the signals with name and number.
	-L 				--table				List signal names in a nice table.

Some regularly used signals are listed bellow:

	Number		Name		Description
	------		----		-----------
	  1			HUP			Hang up.
	  2			INT			Interrupt. This signal can be sent by ^c.
	  3			QUIT		Quit.
	  9			KILL		This signal is directly sent to kernel, which terminates the process immediately. But this is unclean, for the
							process can't clean up its memory usage.
	  15		TERM		This is the default. If the process is alive enough to receive the signal, it will terminate.
	  19		STOP		Pause the process, stop it for a while. This signal is also sent to kernel and thus can't be ignored.
	  18		CONT		Continue. This will restore a process after STOP signal.
	  20		TSTP		Terminal stop. This is the signal sent when ^z is pressed. Unlike STOP and KILL, its received by the process.
	  28		WINCH		Window change, signal to reshape the window.


# killall

Syntax:
-------
	killall [opts] [proc]

	-g			--process-group	Kill the process group to which the process belongs.
	-i			--interactive	Interactively ask for confirmation before killing.
	-l			--list			List all known signal name.
	-n			--ns			Match against PID namespace of a given PID.
	-o			--older-than	Match against any processes older than specified time.
	-y			--younger-than	Match against any processes younger than specified time.
	-q			--quiet			Don't complain if a process was not killed.
	-r			--regex			Interpret process name as regex.
	-s/-SIGNAL	--signal		Send this signal instead of default SIGTERM.
	-u			--user			Kill only processes that specified user owns.
	-v			--verbose		Report if signal was successfully sent.
