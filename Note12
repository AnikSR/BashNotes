# uptime

Syntax:
-------
	uptime [options]

Details:
--------
	uptime tells how long the system has been running. It prints a one line description:

	[Current time] [How long the system is running] [How many user is logged on] (Average system load at-)[5min] [10min] [15min]

Options:
--------
	-p	--pretty	Show uptime in pretty format.
	-s	--since		Show since when the system is up. Display that in yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS format.
	-h	--help		Print help information and exit.
	-v	--version	Print version information and exit.

For example, uptime in current system outputs this for the current time:

	07:55:13 up  1:29,  1 user,  load average: 0.07, 0.06, 0.07

So, the system is running for 1h 29min with one user with a very small average load.
