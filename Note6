# grep

Syntax:
-------
	grep [-options] <pattern> [file...]

Description:
------------
	grep searches for pattern in each [file]. When no [file] is given, grep recursively searches the working directory and nonrecursively
searches the standard input. The stdin can also be given as input using '-' for [file]. grep prints the matching lines as output.

Options:
--------
	-E	--extended-regexp	Interpret <pattern> as extended regular expression. This can also be invoked using egrep.
	-F	--fixed-string		Instead of regular expression, treat <pattern> as fixed string seperated by newlines, any of which to
					be matched. This is also unvoked using fgrep.
	-G	--basic-regexp		Interpret patter as basic regular expression.
	-P	--perl-regexp		Interpret the pattern as Perl compatible regular expression.
