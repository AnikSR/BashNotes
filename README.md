# BashNotes
These are my study notes on bash. It mostly on various bash commands, but also on includes some file on line editing, bash prompt, command completion, history expansion, regular expression, scripting etc. Most of these materials are taken from respective man pages, so there's really very little new here. In my study I've came accross many brilliant books, many portion of my notes are from those books as well. Here are all my sorces:

  1. Linux man pages.
  2. The Linux Command Line, A complete introduction by William E. Shotts, Jr. Published 2012
  3. How Linux Works: What Every Superuser Should Know 2E by Brian Ward. Published 2015
  4. Various sites on the internet including stackoverflow.com
